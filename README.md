This application is a short, timed code quiz that gives the user points for correct answers and deducts time from the timer on incorrect answers. If the user 
completes the quiz before the time is up, the quiz ends (the timer still drops to zero) and the user can input their initials. If the timer runs out before the 
user has completed the quiz, the quiz is over and the user can still input their initials into the prompt. 

After the initials are input, the initials and user score are displayed together.
